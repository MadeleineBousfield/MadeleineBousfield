# Hi, I'm Madeleine Bousfield
A HND Computing Graduate interested in a career in manual testing. 

## About Me 
I am a highly motivated HND Computing graduate with a proven ability to work in an organised and independent manner while communicating effectively within a team. I am capable of learning new skills quickly, understanding how to apply skills to new problems, and thrive in approaching problems in a pragmatic and strategic way.
<br><br>After transitioning to study computing, I have been exploring my interest in QA and building my knowledge, skills, and experience of software testing. I am familiar with analysing requirements, developing test cases using tools such as Jira and Trello, and agile testing methods.

## Experience 
### The complete 2024 software testing bootcampÂ 
Since completing my HND I have been independently studying software testing techniques, using a course that follows the ISTQB curriculum. I have currently completed the manual testing portion of this course and have several accompanying practical projects listed in my GitHub portfolio. These include:
* Test scenario and test case writing in Trello and ZephyrScale
* Agile testing in Jira: writing epics and stories, writing acceptance criteria, managing a project backlog, creating sprints, and generating reports
* Writing bug reports in Jira
* Introductory exposure to API testing using Postman
* Introductory exposure to performance testing using JMeter
<br><br>I am looking forward to continuing to build my manual testing portfolio as well as learning more about automated testing.

### Exploratory Testing
I have performed exploratory testing on several game demos and websites using Jira and Xray to record notes and bug reports. I perform these in timed sessions or 20 minutes to 1 hour in order to practice effective exploration and bug identification. 

### Other Work Experience
My education journey has equipped me the confidence to work both independently and in a team. I have contributed to many group projects during my degree and HND, often taking leading roles and/or time and resource management roles during these. I have also consistently produced high quality written communications throughout my academic career, ranging from reports, project post-mortems, argumentative essays and subject literature reviews. 
<br><br>In customer service roles I have maintained friendly and helpful customer interactions, and have demonstrated good problem solving and conflict resolution. Likewise, I have demonstrated flexibility and a good sense of prioritisation while completing tasks independently, following company policies and legal requirements as per role requirements.

## Other Interests
I love to knit, sew and try my hand at any new craft that crosses my path. 
<br>My love of knitting was my first inspiration to pursue computing, since I have found that many skills translate well (such as conceptualising products from written instructions, methodical problem solving both at a high and low level and a lot of patience. 
An invaluable lesson I have carried into QA from these hobbies is to be positive about my skills and better recognise the improvements I make over time as I work towards my goals.
