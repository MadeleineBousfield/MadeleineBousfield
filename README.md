# Hi, I'm Madeleine Bousfield
A HND Computing Graduate interested in a career in manual testing. 

## About Me 
I am a highly motivated individual with a proven ability to learn quickly and independently, with excellent organisational skills, time management and self-discipline. 
<br>Following completion of my degree, I transitioned to study computing after realising that a career in this field would best fulfil the skills I want to utilise in a career. I have since continued to explore my interest in testing, learning more about the field and building my knowledge, skills and experience. I am therefore excited to share my portfolio and begin a career in QA. 

## Education
HND Computing 
<br>Weymouth College | Sep 2022 - Jun 2023

## Experience 
I have been following a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/testerbootcamp/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) to develop a fundamental knowledge of software testing techniques covered by the ISTQB curriculum. I have currently completed the manual testing portion of this course and have a number of accompanying practical projects listed in my portfolio. This includes:
* Test scenario and test case writing in Trello and ZephyrScale
* Agile testing in Jira: writing epics and stories, writing acceptance criteria, managing a project backlog, creating sprints, and generating reports. 
* Writing bug reports in Jira.
* Introductory exposure to API testing using Postman.
* Introductory exposure to performance testing using JMeter.

I am looking forward to continuing to build my manual testing portfolio as well as moving on to learn more about automated testing.

## Other Skills
My education journey has equipped me the confidence to work both independently and in a team. I have contributed to many group projects during my degree and HND, often taking leading roles and/or time and resource management roles during these. I have also consistently produced high quality written communications throughout my academic career, ranging from reports, project post-mortems, argumentative essays and subject literature reviews. 
<br>In customer service roles I have maintained friendly and helpful customer interactions, and have demonstrated good problem solving and conflict resolution. Likewise, I have demonstrated flexibility and a good sense of prioritisation while completing tasks independently, following company policies and legal requirements as per role requirements.

## Other Interests
I love to knit, sew and try my hand at any new craft that crosses my path. 
<br>My love of knitting was my first inspiration to pursue computing, since I have found that many skills translate well (such as conceptualising products from written instructions, methodical problem solving both at a high and low level and a lot of patience. 
An invaluable lesson I have carried into QA from these hobbies is to be positive about my skills and better recognise the improvements I make over time as I work towards my goals.
