# Hi, I'm Madeleine Bousfield
A HND Computing graduate interested in a career in QA/QC. 

## About Me 
I am a highly motivated HND Computing graduate with a proven ability to work in an organised and independent manner while communicating effectively within a team. I am capable of learning new skills quickly, understanding how to apply skills to new problems, and thrive in approaching challenges in a proactive and methodical way.
<br><br>After transitioning to study computing, I have been exploring my interest in QA/QC and building my knowledge, skills, and experience of testing techniques. I am familiar with manual testing techniques, agile testing methods, and test design and bug reporting software including Jira, Trello and Xray.  

## Education
### HND Computing 
Weymouth College | Sep 2022 - Jun 2023
<br>Grade: Distinction
<br>
* Object oriented programming - C++
* Game design and development using Unreal Engine
* Website design and development using HTML and CSS
* Security

* Database design and development
* Internet of Things
<br><br>
### BA Museum and Classical Studies
University of Reading | Oct 2019 - May 2021
<br>Grade: First with Honours

## Experience 
### The complete 2024 software testing bootcampÂ 
Since completing my HND I have been independently studying testing techniques, using a course that follows the ISTQB curriculum  and have several accompanying practical projects listed in my GitHub portfolio. These include:
* Test scenario and test case writing in Trello and ZephyrScale
* Agile testing in Jira: writing epics and stories, writing acceptance criteria, managing a project backlog, creating sprints, and generating reports
* Writing bug reports in Jira
* Introductory exposure to API testing using Postman
* Introductory exposure to performance testing using JMeter

### Exploratory Testing
I regularly practice effective bug identification and reporting by performing timed exploratory testing sessions on 
games and game demos using Xray Exploratory App.
<br><br>
I have also designed and conducted structured functional testing on a game developed during my HND game 
design module. This has included analysing design requirements, test design across mechanics, levels, graphics, 
audio, UI and peripherals, and bug reporting.

### C++ for Unreal Engine
I am currently learning C++ for Unreal Engine while developing a personal game project, to build upon my 
experience of developing a game using blueprints. This is greatly supporting my ability to identify testing 
opportunities and develop effective testing and reporting processes in other projects.

### Other Work Experience
My education journey has equipped me the confidence to work both independently and in a team. I have contributed to many group projects during my degree and HND, often taking leading roles and/or time and resource management roles during these. I have also consistently produced high quality written communications throughout my academic career, ranging from reports, project post-mortems, argumentative essays and subject literature reviews. 
<br><br>In customer service roles I have maintained friendly and helpful customer interactions, and have demonstrated good problem solving and conflict resolution. Likewise, I have demonstrated flexibility and a good sense of prioritisation while completing tasks independently, following company policies and legal requirements as per role requirements.
